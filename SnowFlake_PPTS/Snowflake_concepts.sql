Key Topics to Prepare for Snowflake Interviews:
Snowflake Architecture

Understand Snowflakes architecture (separation of storage and compute, virtual warehouses, metadata storage).
Differences between Snowflake and traditional databases or cloud databases.
Data Loading and Unloading

How to load data into Snowflake using COPY INTO and external stages.
How to unload data from Snowflake.
Using Snowflakes Snowpipe for continuous data loading.
Data Modeling and Best Practices

Designing schemas (star schema, snowflake schema).
Using shared databases and schema management in Snowflake.
Performance Optimization

Clustering keys and their impact on performance.
Query optimization and caching in Snowflake.
Scaling virtual warehouses (auto-suspend, auto-resume).
Security Features

Role-based access control (RBAC).
Data masking policies.
Network policies and end-to-end encryption.
Time Travel and Zero-Copy Cloning

Understanding Snowflakes time travel feature for historical data queries.
Using zero-copy cloning for environment replication and testing.
Integration with Other Tools

How Snowflake integrates with ETL/ELT tools (e.g., Informatica, Matillion, Talend).
Integration with BI tools like Tableau or Power BI.
Stored Procedures and Functions

Writing and using stored procedures in Snowflake.
Difference between Snowflake SQL UDFs and JavaScript UDFs.
Handling Semi-Structured Data

Working with JSON, Avro, ORC, or Parquet in Snowflake.
Using VARIANT data type and querying it with FLATTEN.
Monitoring and Maintenance

Query profiling using QUERY_HISTORY.
Resource monitoring (warehouse utilization, storage costs).
Sample Questions:
Basic and Theoretical Questions
Can you explain the architecture of Snowflake and how it differs from traditional databases?
What are the key advantages of Snowflakes multi-cluster shared data architecture?
How does Snowflake ensure high concurrency and scalability?
Scenario-Based Questions
How would you load a large dataset (e.g., 5 TB) into Snowflake efficiently? What steps would you take?
A query on a large table is running slowly. How would you debug and optimize it?
You need to mask sensitive salary data in a column. How would you implement this in Snowflake?
Hands-On/Practical Questions
Write a query to extract nested JSON data from a VARIANT column.
Create a virtual warehouse and set it up for auto-scaling and auto-suspend.
Demonstrate how to implement time travel to recover data deleted two days ago.
Advanced Questions
How does Snowflakes data sharing feature work, and how can it be used across different accounts?
Explain clustering keys and how they improve query performance in Snowflake.
What are the considerations for choosing the size of a virtual warehouse?
Integration and Ecosystem Questions
How would you integrate Snowflake with AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage for data ingestion?
How can you connect Snowflake to Tableau for reporting?
How does Snowflake manage semi-structured data, and how do you query it?
Tips for Success:
Hands-on Practice: Set up a Snowflake trial account and practice creating databases, schemas, and loading/unloading data.
Scenario-Based Solutions: Be prepared to discuss real-world use cases and challenges you’ve faced with Snowflake.
Cost Optimization: Have an understanding of Snowflake’s pricing model and how to optimize compute/storage costs.
Certifications: If you have Snowflake certifications, highlight them. If not, consider studying for the SnowPro Core Certification to enhance your knowledge and credibility.
