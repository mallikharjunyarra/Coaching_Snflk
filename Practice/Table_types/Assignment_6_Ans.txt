1. How do we do continuous loading in snowflake?
	By using SnowPipes

2. Write a query to create snowpipe named 'amazonpipe' to load the files from 'aws/pipes' folder

    CREATE OR REPLACE file format myown_db.public.csv_fileformat
    type = csv
    field_delimiter = ','
    skip_header = 1
    empty_field_as_null = TRUE;

  create or replace storage integration s3_int
  TYPE = EXTERNAL_STAGE
  STORAGE_PROVIDER = S3
  ENABLED = TRUE 
  STORAGE_AWS_ROLE_ARN = 'arn:aws:iam::555064756008:role/snowflake_access_role'
  STORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS = ('s3://aws/pipes', 's3://aws/json/','s3://aws/csv/')
  COMMENT = 'Access to my s3 buckets' ;

  CREATE OR REPLACE stage myown_db.public.stage_aws_pipes
    URL = 's3://aws/pipes/'
    STORAGE_INTEGRATION = s3_int
    FILE_FORMAT = myown_db.public.csv_fileformat;

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE myown_db.public.Person
(
  id INT,
  first_name STRING,
  last_name STRING,
  email STRING,
  phone number
);

// Create a pipe
CREATE OR REPLACE pipe myown_db.public.Person_pipe
auto_ingest = TRUE
AS
COPY INTO myown_db.public.Person
FROM @myown_db.public.stage_aws_pipes;


3. How to pause snowpipe execution?
	ALTER PIPE myown_db.public.Person_pipe SET PIPE_EXECUTION_PAUSED = true;

4. Explain about caching in snowflake? howmany types and what is the advantage?
   Snowflake uses data cache as well as result cache in different layers for sql query performance.
   there are 3 types of cache in snowflake:
 1. Result Cache: This cache holds the result of every query executed in next 24 hours.This is for fast retrival of data for the next time the same query is executed.
    This can greatly reduce the query time.These result sets are available across VMs.
 2. Local Disk Cache:This cache stores data used by SQl queries. Whenever data is needed for a given query it is retrieved from the remote disk and stored in this layer.
 3. Remote Disk:THis is the storage layer of snowflake. It stores the data for long term.
 
5. What is the retention period in snowflake and what is the retention period of Transient tables?
	Retention period is the number of days for which the historical data (changed or deleted data) is preserved. 
	Deafult value of retention period is 1 which can extend to 90 days for Enterprise edition of snowflake. Higher the retention period, higher is the cost.
	Transient tables has 1 day retention period.

6. I have 1000 records in a table, by mistake I have deleted 200 records from the table. After 1 day I realized I need those deleted records. Write a query to to display only those 200 deleted records. I dont want to see all 1000 records. (Take google help if needed)
	SELECT * FROM <table_name> AT(timestamp => (select dateadd(hour,-24,current_timestamp())))
	MINUS
	SELECT * FROM <table_name>
   
7. Write a query to clone entire schema named 'STAGING_TABLES'
	CREATE SCHEMA myown_db.Stg_Tbl_Cln
      CLONE myown_db.STAGING_TABLES;

8. Tell me one realtime use case where Cloning is useful
	1.for database backups
   	2.for moving data from production to development environment for tesing purpose.

9. What is the purpose of creating Transient tables in snowflake?
	Transient tables are used for data that can be maintained even after a session ends but no need to maintain the data for long time. 
	stage tables are good examples of transient tables.
 
10. What are the storage types available in snowflake and how can we choose storage type for our project?
	There are 2 types of storage:
	1.On Demand 
	2.Capacity Usage

     In the intial phase of a project when the customer is not sure about the amount of storage requried,ON Demand storage is used.
     once the application storage requirement is understood, an appropriately sized Capacity purchase can be made.
